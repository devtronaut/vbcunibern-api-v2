### VBC Uni Bern API V2

The VBC Uni Bern API V2 (VBCUB API V2) is based on the new Swiss Volley API.
Most relevant change in the new Swiss Volley API is that it now follows a RESTful approach instead of the previous SOAP approach.

The following architectural setup will be used for the VBCU API V2:
- Node with TypeScript and Express to implement the API
- MongoDB with the mongoose library to store the data
- Azure for the production environment
